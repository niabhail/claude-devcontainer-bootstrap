## ðŸŒ± Beginner Setup

**New to development?** Don't worry! Follow these simple steps with explanations.

## âš¡ Step 1: Choose Your Model

**What this does**: Sets up Claude Code to use the best AI model for development.

```
/models
```
**Instructions**: When the menu appears, select **Sonnet** (it's the best balance of speed and intelligence).

## âš¡ Step 2: Initialize Your Development Environment

**What this does**: Sets up enhanced coding assistance with specialized tools.

```
/sc:load
```
**What to expect**: You'll see messages about loading development tools. This is normal!

## âš¡ Step 3: Get Coding Help

**What this does**: Activates your AI coding assistant to help with your project.

```
/sc:initialize

I'm new to development and want to start a simple project. Please set up:
- Basic coding assistance
- Code explanations when I need help
- Simple project guidance
- Save my progress automatically

Help me understand what tools are now available and how to use them for learning.
```

**What to expect**: Claude will confirm your setup and explain the basic features available to you.

## ðŸš€ Advanced Setup

**Experienced with development?** Here are the enterprise-grade features available to you.

### Multi-Expert Strategic Analysis

**Use Case**: Business requirements, product strategy, technical architecture planning

```bash
/sc:analyze @your_requirements.md --business-panel

Use SuperClaude business analysis framework:
- Multi-expert business analysis (Porter, Christensen, Drucker frameworks)
- Strategic requirement evaluation and technical architecture design
- Risk assessment and compliance analysis with /sc:security persona
- Implementation planning with /sc:backend and /sc:frontend personas
- Quality strategy development with /sc:quality persona

Generate comprehensive analysis with strategic insights and implementation roadmap.
```

### Enterprise Team Orchestration

**Use Case**: Large development teams, complex projects, multi-persona coordination

```bash
/sc:team-setup

Configure specialized SuperClaude personas for enterprise development:

**Primary Personas**: Map requirements to optimal combinations
- Architecture decisions â†’ /sc:architect 
- Frontend development â†’ /sc:frontend + /sc:ui-expert
- Backend services â†’ /sc:backend + /sc:system-architect  
- Security & compliance â†’ /sc:security + /sc:devops
- Quality assurance â†’ /sc:quality + /sc:performance

**Enterprise Capabilities**:
- Cross-persona validation and quality gates
- Systematic handoffs between development phases
- 6 integrated MCP servers (context7, morphllm, playwright, serena, etc.)
- Token optimization and session persistence for large-scale projects

Generate persona-specific workflows for immediate enterprise use.
```

### TaskMaster Integration (If Enabled)

**Use Case**: Project management integration, task tracking, team coordination

```bash
Initialize TaskMaster AI for this project:
- Main model: claude-code/sonnet (no API key needed)
- Research model: perplexity/sonar-pro  
- Fallback model: claude-code/opus
- Enable VS Code, Git, and Claude Code integration
- Prioritize efficient model usage

# Integration workflow:
1. Convert SuperClaude analysis into actionable development tasks
2. Create comprehensive task breakdown with complexity estimation
3. Set up task prioritization and dependency tracking
4. Configure automated progress tracking and reporting
5. Link TaskMaster tasks with SuperClaude personas for specialized execution
```

### Advanced Workflow Optimization

**Use Case**: Production-scale development, token optimization, session management

```bash
/sc:workflow-optimize

Set up ongoing enterprise SuperClaude workflows:
- Session Management: Automatic checkpoints and project memory persistence
- Token Optimization: Ultracompressed mode for large-scale operations  
- Quality Integration: Continuous validation with persona cross-checks
- Productivity Enhancement: Specialized commands for common development tasks
- Documentation: Automatic technical documentation generation

# TaskMaster Integration (if enabled):
- Daily progress reports from SuperClaude persona work
- Sprint planning with SuperClaude architectural analysis
- Quality gates linking task completion with persona validation
```
